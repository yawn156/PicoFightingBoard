# Pico Fighting Board

Small fork of the OG Pico Fighting Board.

The idea behind this fork is for use with the [Open Stick](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/tree/main/Fightstick%20Case) case, packing together less features than you would get from more advanced boards but also just enough to build a fightstick (with PS4/5 support with the new Passthrough addon).

Another important aspect about this fork is the focus on manual assembly to reduce costs and wait time for the big demand in common used parts from JLCPCB's assembly.
